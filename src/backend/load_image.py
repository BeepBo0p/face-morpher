"""
This file contains the code for loading the image and converting it into a standard format.

While working on the MVP we will assume that the images are already in a standard format.

That is to say: dim(A) = dim(B) = (W, H, 3) 

where W, H are the width and height of the image respectively, and 3 is the number of channels (RGB).

At a later stage we will maybe add code to convert the images to a standard format, 
but this is a sort of pre-processing step and can be done in an outside program.
